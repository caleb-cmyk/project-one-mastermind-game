<h1>Mastermind</h1>
Mastermind's simple. Guess the colour of each of the four circles in correct order. If the circle's colour and position are correct, the hint will light up green. If the colour is one of the four correct colours but in the wrong position, the hint will light up red. If both the colour and position are wrong, the hint will not light up. Guess within the maximum number of tries and be the master.
